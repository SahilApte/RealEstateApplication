## Real Estate Application Using Ethereum

The Real Estate Application is a venture-based project designed to operate on the Ethereum and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) networks. Its primary purpose is to enable Venture Owners to set up their ventures, facilitating all property-related transactions within the network using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as Property Documents. This approach enhances security, reduces fraud, and streamlines the overall process, making it faster and more efficient.

### Project Components:

1. **NFT.sol**: This smart contract plays a crucial role in minting NFTs for the ventures. Additionally, it contains a function that efficiently displays data on the frontend.

2. **Real_Estate.sol**: The heart of the project, this smart contract holds the entire logic for the application and incorporates all essential functionalities.

3. **Ethers.JS**: Used for seamless communication with the Ethereum blockchain, Ethers.js is an essential tool for interacting with the network.

4. **Frontend**: The frontend of the application is built using the following technologies:

   - HTML
   - JavaScript
   - CSS
   - Vue.js
   - ElementUI
   - Ether.js
